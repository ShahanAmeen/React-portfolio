        Shahan is a student at the University of Minnesota coding Full Stack Bootcamp this fall. His goal is to complete the bootcamp and to become a professional in the field of coding. He has a bachelor’s in business administration from the University of Wisconsin-Stout. Right after graduation, Shahan got a phone call that his father had a severe illness, and he would have to operate his father’s restaurant while he goes through treatment. He took the position of lead manager at Cravings Wine Bar & Grille where he helped lead his team operate a small scale of American fine dining cuisine. During this time Shahan developed skills in operations & revenue management, complied and audited financial reports, and most importantly made interpersonal connection with his guests to make sure they had a wonderful experience. Due to Shahan's persistent nature, he believes he has what it takes to become a successful developer and is learn quickly.
